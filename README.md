## Installing
To install, download the latest release zip file.  This file will contain a file `blurdeform.mod` and a folder `blurdeform` .  Place both of these in `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\maya\modules`  (you may have to create this folder).  Then restart Maya.  
Finally, make a Python shelf button with this script:
```python
import blurdeform
blurdeform.runBlurDeformUI()
```
